# Project Context

## Project Overview
A personalized life calendar website that visualizes a user's lifespan as a grid of circles, where each circle represents one day. Users can input their personal information (name, birth date, location) and see their life progress in real-time. The application includes a journaling feature that allows users to log daily experiences and link them to specific days in their life calendar.

## Requirements
- **User Profile**: Name, date of birth, birth location input
- **Life Grid Visualization**: Grid of circles representing days lived vs. total lifespan
- **Real-time Updates**: Calendar updates automatically as time passes
- **Journaling System**: Ability to log entries for specific days
- **Day Linking**: Journal entries linked to specific circles/days
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Data Persistence**: User data and journal entries saved locally

## Constraints
- **Frontend Only**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no backend required initially)
- **Local Storage**: Data persistence using browser's localStorage
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern browsers (ES6+ support)
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering of large grid (90+ years = 32,000+ days)

## Success Criteria
- User can create personalized life calendar with their information
- Grid accurately shows days lived vs. remaining lifespan
- Real-time updates work correctly
- Journaling feature allows linking entries to specific days
- Interface is intuitive and visually appealing
- Application works offline after initial load

## Stakeholders
